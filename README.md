# Digital Signal Processing (DCA3602)

This repository contains the projects developed for the course **DCA3602 - Digital Signal Processing**, offered by the **Department of Computer Engineering and Automation (DCA)** at the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)**.

## About
The course covers fundamental concepts and applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), including convolution, FIR filters, and other signal analysis techniques.  
Each project is first implemented in **MATLAB** and later adapted to **Python**.

## Repository Structure
- `project1-convolution/` – Convolution of a voice signal with the acoustic impulse response of the Schellingwoude Church (Amsterdam)  
- Additional projects will be added throughout the semester  

Each project folder contains:
- `matlab/` – MATLAB implementation (`.m` files)  
- `python/` – Python implementation (`.py` files)  
- `explicacao.md` – Supporting file written in **Portuguese**, describing the problem, the reasoning, and the theoretical background
